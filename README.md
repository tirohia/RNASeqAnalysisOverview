# RNASeqAnalysisOverview
Quick overview of RNA seq data. 

This code is for a shiny app that provides a quick overview of RNASeq data prior to a more indepth analysis

A version of this app was initally concieved of and coded by Cris Print. Significant changes have since been made. 

A copy of heatmap-mik.R is currently required in the same working directory. This can be found from https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/R-Heatmap-Functions
